                        <p>I am delighted to welcome you to The Kings of Wessex Academy - one of the top performing schools in the country.
                        </p>
                        <p>Kings is a high achieving 13-18 years school. Exam results are consistently high year-on-year, with students making outstanding progress from Key Stage 2 to 4, and after the Sixth Form many students go on to top universities.
                        </p>                   
                        <p>Accolades and league tables are important, but there's more to Kings than percentages and statistics.
                        </p>
                        <p>We believe in every child, and have high expectations regardless of their background, and we take pride in excellent attendance and behaviour, a positive attitude, and smart uniform. We want every child who attends Kings to be happy in their learning and believe that they can succeed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our dedicated and committed staff are here to guide and support students on a daily basis so that they feel loved, cared for and supported.
                        </p>
                        <p>Kings is very much a community school within the heart of the beautiful Cheddar Valley here in Somerset, and is an Upper School of the family of soon to be 16 First and Middle Schools.
                        </p>
                        <p>We are part of the Wessex Learning Trust that strives to offer a world class, 21st century education for all young people between the ages of 2 and 18, by providing outstanding learning opportunities and creating centres of educational excellence that meet the needs of all children.
                        </p>
                        <p>We are passionate that our work in the classroom inspires a love of learning, enquiry and creativity as we strive to develop our young people to prepare them for life and their next steps in our globally competitive world.
                        </p>
                        <p>As an Upper School, exams are obviously a significant part of our work and goals, so that every lesson, every piece of homework really counts. We encourage students to do their best and take pride in their subjects so that ultimately in the final exams they will realise their true potential.
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Students who join Kings at 13 in Year 9 embark directly on their three-year Key Stage 4 course for their GCSE's so that they have an extra year to prepare, which has proved to be reassuring and effective. For the final year of Year 11 each student is assigned a staff Mentor with whom they meet to review progress and extra support and to feel really boosted. Students are also encourage to attend golden time extra sessions during the year and as the exam season gets closer, a dedicated programme of revision sessions in the Easter holidays.
                        </p>
                        <p>But as well as learning for exams, there is a delight in learning for life and we offer a wide range of enlivening enrichment activities, including trips here in the UK, as well as even more adventurous overseas; along with guest speakers and lots of clubs, sporting and musical activities.
                        </p>
                        <p>Over the years the Academy, has worked hard to improve the facilities on the campus to ensure a safe and smart learning environment, but also somewhere exciting and modern for students to study. Many of the classrooms and building blocks have been refurbished and there has been considerable investment in IT facilities. Students enjoy our very own Kings Theatre, state-of-the-art Design Technology facilities, and benefit from the on-site Kings Fitness Leisure Centre.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Academy enjoys valuable links with the community and we are grateful to our local champions who support us, including our volunteer readers, the PTA, Mendip Rotary and Cheddar Arts @Kings Theatre.
                        </p>
                        <p>In my privileged position as Headteacher of The Kings of Wessex Academy, I very much look forward to working with all our parents and partners.
                        </p>
                        <p>We all know that education is an essential time in a child's life. I thank you for all your encouragement and nurturing behind the scenes at home to help your child get the most out of their time at Kings.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you would like more information about our Academy, then please do contact us. We are always delighted to tell you more about our work.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Believe and succeed!</p>
